**Background:**

BusyFlights is a flights search solution which aggregates flight results initially from 2 different suppliers (CrazyAir and ToughJet). A future iteration (not part of the test) may add more suppliers.

**What is required:**

The result should be a JSON response which contains a list of flights ordered by fare which has the following attributes:
